# SpellForge
SpellForge is an online web game in which you are a wizard that slowly gains spells and strives to have the strongest spell in the lands. These spells can be fused to make stronger, better spells. To get spells, you enter a code and the code gives you a spell. At level 1, you can enter a code every 24 hrs and the cooldown time gets shorter as you level up. You can level up by fusing spells.
## Notice
This game is more of an idea than an actual game. This game is still very much in progress, and it's in its pre-alpha stages.
