# SpellForge
SpellForge is an online web game in which you are a wizard. You slowly gain spells and you strive to have the strongest spell in the lands. These spells can be fused to make stronger, better spells. To get spells, you can get a random one by pressing a button. At level 1, you can enter a code every 12 hrs and the cooldown time gets shorter as you level up. You can level up by fusing spells.
